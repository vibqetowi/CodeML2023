# Quantum magnetometer (Challenge 1)

### Description of the challenge

---

Difficulty: Easy

At SB Quantum, we develop diamond-based magnetometers to measure magnetic fields very accurately. However, the field reading is influenced by temperature and the various electrical currents in the device. Our aim is to compensate for these effects to obtain a stable reading of the surrounding magnetic field, using various regression techniques. Our data are contained in CSV format files, including:

- Dependent variables: magnetic field components (X, Y, Z)
- Independent variables: device electrical currents, temperature data from various sensors.
  ### What you will accomplish

---

The challenge is to predict the magnetic field variation caused by temperature and current variations in a quantum magnetometer.

### Criteria for judgement

---

We will score your submissions based on - SMAPE score. The score on the leadboard is the harmonic mean between the - SMAPE score and the other metrics if applicable.

This challenge will require you to have a model that can accurately predict the variations of temperature and current variations in a quantum magnetometer..

A presentation of the method used by the winners will be requested. The code must also be given.

- R^2
- SMAPE
