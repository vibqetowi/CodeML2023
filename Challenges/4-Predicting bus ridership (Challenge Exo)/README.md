# Predicting bus ridership (Challenge Exo)

### Description of the challenge

---

All exo buses - over 650 vehicles - are equipped with automatic passenger sensors. However, the sensors sometimes fail on certain bus departures. Using passenger sensor data from several thousand bus trips, the challenge is to develop a model to predict ridership on bus trips where sensor data is missing. The ultimate goal is to be able to estimate operational ridership on the network as accurately as possible.

At the moment, we're working with simple models (moving average), but we'd like to improve our forecasts with more sophisticated models to take into account different factors (seasonality, weather, stacking of previous trips, schedule adherenc

### What you will accomplish

---

The aim of this challenge is to develop a model for predicting bus trip ridership where sensor data is missing.

### Criteria for judgement

---

We will score your submissions based on - SMAPE score. The score on the leadboard is the harmonic mean between the - SMAPE score and the other metrics if applicable.

A presentation of the method used by the winners will be requested. The code must also be given.
